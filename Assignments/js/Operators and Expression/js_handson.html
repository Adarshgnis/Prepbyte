        <h3>Add two Numbers</h3>
        <p>You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers.</p><br>
        <pre>
            c = a+b;

        <h3>Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?</h3>
        <p>You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions (A<10 and A>B) are satisfied or not with the help of operators</p><br>
        <pre>

        <h3>Check the conditons</h3>
        <p>You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:<br>
            1. if both are divisible by 10 console true.<br>
            2. if both are not divisible by 10 console false.<br>
            3. if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.<br>
            Use operator to do this</p><br>
